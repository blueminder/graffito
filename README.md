# graffito

Anonymous tagging via geolocation.

## About

**graffito** is a mobile webapp that allows you to leave messages in any physical location for other users to find later.

This webapp was largely created as an excuse to experiment with Scalatra, MongoDB, and iUI to make mobile web applications.

## TODO

- Limit displayed tags to match distance radius around user
- Create map link for each tag coordinate
